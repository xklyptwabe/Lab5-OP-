Tabulate the function specified according to the option on the interval [a, b] with step h in two ways.
To calculate the value of the function y at the point x ∈ [a , b ]:
1) first method: declare and implement the function in C, whose formal parameter is x, and the result of the function is the value y;
2) second method: declare and implement the function in C, the first formal parameter of the function is x, the second formal parameter is the argument, where the result of the calculation according to the formula will be returned. The function returns:
{−1 if y <0 ;
0 if y=0 ;
1 if y > 0.
Format the tabulation as a separate function. Present the calculation results in table form. Place all functions in the header file.

1 / x square(x2 - 1), where a = -3, b = -2
